## Academic and Personal Projects
### IPA (Interactive Portfolio Analyser)
A Python dashboard project developing investment strategy models based on Modern Portfolio Theory. By harnessing machine learning libraries in Python, this dashboard finds optimally weighted portfolios for a range of objective functions and constraints. The objective functions explored include conditional value at risk (cVar) minimisation and Sharpe Ratio maximisation and can be benchmarked against a variety of configurations and index funds.

### Derivative Pricing Dashboard
A personal project developing an app in Python using Streamlit. The purpose of the app is to use Black-Scholes-Merton pricing and binomial pricing models in order to determine the theoretical value of American options. The dashboard will take in any ticker and expiry date and dynamically update the relevant graphs and analyses showing pricing disparities at different strike prices. Please note that occasionally the downloaded option chain will have a Bid/Ask of 0, this is most likely because it is outside Market Hours.

### Student Loan Repayment Calculator
A handy tool which uses current interest rates to calculate your student loan balance over time. You are able to set your current salary, plan, and even input potential future earnings to visualise how the balance changes dynamically.
