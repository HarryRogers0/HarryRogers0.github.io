## Academic and Personal Projects
### Derivative Pricing Dashboard
A personal project developing an app in Python using Streamlit. The purpose of the app is to use Black-Scholes-Merton pricing and binomial pricing models in order to determine the theoretical value of American options. The dashboard will take in any ticker and expiry date and dynamically update the relevant graphs and analyses showing pricing disparities at different strike prices.
